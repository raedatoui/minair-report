# The Minair Report

https://minair.me 

The Minair Report came to life during the height of the pandemic.
On the surface, the website is a real-time data visualization for an indoor air
quality sensor named “Minair” that lives in Brooklyn, NY. During the lockdown, a
group of friends met virtually every Friday night for some socializing/games.
It was during these meet ups that Minair was created. Each weekly meeting the
group would iterate on the latest developments. Eventually it became highly
self-referential, leading to memes, original songs, erotica stories, and more.
